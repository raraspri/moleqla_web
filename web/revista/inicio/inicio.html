        <p>In October 2011 a group of people connected to the University Pablo de Olavide met in order to synthesize a Review of Chemistry for our University. To do this we needed a laboratory in which to work, materials and ingredients to carry out the reaction and a good method that would allow us to obtain the reaction product with optimal performance.</p>

        <p>Although we have had a couple of meetings in a classroom, our laboratory has been based virtual. Through WebCT we have arranged to decide the design, organize work and generally to take almost all major decisions related to the development of this journal. Also our disposal the necessary materials; computers, books, magazines, internet, such a basic editor like Word and to the bottom of the cover a few crayons in the hands of a future artist.</p>
        <p>The ingredients were carefully selected. These consisted of large doses of illusion, several drops of imagination, a bit of our increasingly valuable free time, a stirrer (stirring in this case) to prevent the process is paralyzed and energy that can only provide fifty one people . This energy has been fundamental to successfully carry out the reaction. Today the product resulting from the reaction we present. It is a crude, yet full of impurities that eventually try to improve, but for which we are proud.</p>
        <p>you. We hope you enjoy reading it and I ask for understanding the errors that you find. From here we invite you to contribute your corrections, enhancements, suggestions, comments and why not, to actively participate in upcoming issues and we are already preparing to publish to coincide with the seasons.</p>
